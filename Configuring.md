# Configuring your setup #

**NOTE:** Those steps are a First-time setup and have to be done again only if you change something in the code.


### [Configurator](Configurator.md) ###
To configure your setup, first thing is to run the Configurator.

The Configurator only runs in Windows. If you can't run Windows, you can do the same functions with the text-oriented Command Line Interface.

### [Command Line Interface (CLI)](CLI.md) ###

If you are planning to use a GPS, you have to set up the magnetometers with the CLI.
