# Pre-Flight Checkout #

([ArduCopter's source](http://code.google.com/p/arducopter/wiki/Quad_Testing))

Before your first flight, it is very important that you follow this pre-flight checkout! Use the Configurator plots to visually view your multicopter response graphically.

**The propellers should be taken off to prevent injury. Be careful! Spinning propellers can cause serious injury!!!**

  * Arm the motor output by moving the throttle stick to the lower right. Increase the throttle to 50%.

  * By hand, roll the multicopter to the left. The left motor command should increase. The right motor command should decrease.

  * Roll the multicopter to the right. The right motor command should increase. The left motor command should decrease.

  * Pitch the multicopter down (the front motor should be lower in position than the rear motor). The front motor command should increase. The rear motor command should decrease.

  * Pitch the multicopter up (the front motor should be higher than the rear motor). The rear motor command should increase. The front motor command should decrease.

  * Rotate the multicopter clockwise. The front and rear motor commands should increase (assuming the motors are wired to rotate in the clockwise direction).

  * Rotate the multicopter counter-clockwise. The left and right motor commands should increase in value (assuming the motors are wired to rotate in the counter-clockwise direction).

  * Using the transmitter, move the roll stick to the left. The right motor command should increase. The left motor command should decrease.

  * Move the roll stick to the right. The left motor command should increase. The right motor command should decrease.

  * Move the pitch stick forward. The rear motor command should increase. The front motor command should decrease.

  * Move the pitch stick back. The front motor command should increase. The rear motor command should decrease.

  * Move the yaw stick to the left. The front and rear motor commands should increase.

  * Move the yaw stick to the right. The left and right motor commands should increase.

## First flights ##

If you pass all pre-flight checks, you can connect propellers and start doing "Hand test" and first learning flights.
