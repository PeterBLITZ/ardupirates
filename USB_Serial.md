# USB to Serial Driver #

The connection between PC and APM can be done through an USB cable or a [FTDI cable](http://store.diydrones.com/FTDI_Cable_3_3V_p/ttl-232r-3v3.htm).

If you are using an earlier version of Windows than Windows 7, you will need [drivers](http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm) for the USB-to-serial port of the shield.
