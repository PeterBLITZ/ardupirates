### Radio and Battery ###

You can use your own Tx and Rx system, the ArduPilot Mega Board is working with quite all systems. Keep in mind that a 6 Channel receiver at least is required. If you want to manualy control a camera trigger, navigation's LED etc., you will need more channels.

Most of multicopters are working with Lipo batteries, in 3S (11,1V) or 4S (14,8V). You can choose your own setup, depending on your motors and ESC's abilities.
