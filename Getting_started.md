# Getting started #


The ArduPirates project focuses on speeding up development on [ArduCopter](http://code.google.com/p/arducopter/wiki/ArduCopter_Quad) especially by integrating self controlling mechanisms without any commercial interests or targets.

The base of this project is Hein's Code which is an exit of the "official" [ArduCopter Code](http://code.google.com/p/arducopter/).

First project was the Arducopter Super Stable Code by Hein and Phil with GPS Hold.

Then, the further development of the "official" Arducopter NG code was taken over by the Pirates. ArduPirates are now teaming up and joining forces with the Arducopter Team. Read DIYDrones founder Chris Anderson's blog announcement [here](http://diydrones.ning.com/profiles/b...-taken-over-by)
