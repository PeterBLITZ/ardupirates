# Softwares installation #

Different softwares are required to load the code into your board and to configure your multicopter. Read all the links before installing.


## [USB to Serial Driver](USB_Serial.md) ##

USB to Serial Driver allows you to create a serial port (necessary for communication between your PC and the APM) through an USB cable.


## [Kinderkram's Installer and ArduCopter Quad Updater](Kinderkram_instal_update.md) ##

Those tools will install **Arduino**, with which you will upload the code to the APM, **Configurator**, which is an "easy-configuration-tool", and finally copy the **code** from the server to your PC.

**You will ever find the latest working version of the code in the [Download Section](http://code.google.com/p/ardupirates/downloads/list).** First install the Kinderkram's Installer and Updater, then download the latest code and finally place the files in the right folders.

## [Tortoise SVN](Tortoise.md) ##

This tool will allows you to access and download the code directly from the source (Trunk). The different codes stored there are usually in developpment/test release, so use them at your own risk...

## [Online Universal Ardu Configurator](Online_Config.md) ##

This incredible tool will create your personal code, depending on the options you choose.
