**Here is a step-by-step how-to** ([ArduCopter's source](http://code.google.com/p/arducopter/wiki/Quad_GettingStarted))

You will need to assemble the ArduPilot Mega _(APM)_ and the IMU Sensor Board _(APM Shield/Oilpan)_.

You will also need the following:
  * A fine-point soldering iron.
  * You'll need some solder, too.

**Assembly:**

First, solder on the two 3x8 right angle headers] for the RC connectors.

Next, we'll cut the headers to attach the IMU shield. Here are the headers that come with the shield

Push a strip of male headers into each row of female headers, then snip off the remaining parts:

When you're done, you should have one male header for each female header:

Now remove the male headers and place them in the holes of the ArduPilot Mega board as shown here:

Place a paper notebook on top of the pins and then, holding the board to the notebook, turn it upside down so you can solder the pins on the back of the board.

Once you've soldered on all the pins, turn the board back over and place the matching female headers on each row of male headers:

Now carefully place the shield on top, ensuring that all the female header pins line up with the right holes, as shown here:

Solder a few pins on each row to hold everything in place, then gently remove the shield. Once it's off, finish soldering all the remaining pins. When you're finished and turn the shield over, it should look like this:

Now you can gently put the shield back on the ArduPilot Mega board. The paired boards should look like this:

You're done with connecting your APM and IMU!
